                <p class="NormalText">
                    Welcome to my website! I'm Atzlk, also known as Connor, and I'm thrilled to have you here. As a YouTuber, programmer, and game developer, this website serves as a hub for my games.
                </p>

                <p class="NormalText">
                    On my Main YouTube channel, I make videos on gaming, programming, and game development. It's a platform that allows me to connect with my community, and I appreciate the opportunity to share my knowledge and experiences with others.
                </p>

                <p class="NormalText">
                    In addition to videos and tutorials, this website is also a repository for the games I showcase on my Main YouTube channel. You'll find a dedicated downloads section, where you can access the games I've created. It's my way of extending the gaming experience beyond videos and allowing you to immerse yourself in the games I've developed.
                </p>

                <p class="NormalText">
                    Moreover, this website serves as a central hub for all my social media channels. You'll find links to my various accounts, including YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and more. Feel free to connect with me on these platforms to stay updated on my latest projects, announcements, and behind-the-scenes insights. This is so you won't have to worry about Atzlk frauds, and can find all offical accounts that I own.
                </p>

                <p class="NormalText">
                    Thank you for visiting, I hope you enjoy this website, though it's still new and in development, I hope you enjoy the current WIP state that it's in.
                </p>
